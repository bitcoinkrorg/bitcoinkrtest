# IS BITCOIN ANONYMOUS?
*  [BITCOIN MAGAZINE](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/authors/bitcoin-magazine) AUG 17, 2020

Bitcoin is not entirely anonymous. In reality, it is /pseudonymous/ because each user has a public address that theoretically could be traced back to an IP address or exchange account (and by proxy, an actual identity) through proper network analysis.

So instead, a better question is, /to what extent/ is Bitcoin anonymous?

It is anonymous in the sense that the components of Bitcoin, such as addresses, private and public keys, and transactions, are all read in text strings, such as a public address, that in no way directly link to anyone’s personal identity. (If an address is used on an exchange that implements KYC — Know Your Customer — then that address may be easily linked to a real-world identity.)
