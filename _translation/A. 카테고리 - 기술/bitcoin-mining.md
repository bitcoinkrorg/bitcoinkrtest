#bitcoin mining

One of the fundamental questions many people have about Bitcoin revolves around the origin of the coins themselves. Questions about its value, security and history all eventually lead to a pair of questions: Where do bitcoin come from and what is bitcoin mining?

“PROOF OF WORK”
If you’ve heard of Bitcoin, there’s a chance you may have also seen the phrase “ proof of work ” thrown around. This process is at the heart of Bitcoin’s ability to work as intended and is what allows the decentralized network of computers running Bitcoin to stay in sync with each other. In fact, this invention is what really separates Bitcoin from any prior attempts at creating digital money.

While traditional money is created through (central) banks, bitcoin are “mined” by Bitcoin miners: network participants that are competing to be the one computer that is allowed to record all of the recent transactions. If your computer can win this competition, then you’ll get to award yourself some bitcoin as a reward for your efforts.
